        <p class="about"><strong>ABOUT THE COMPANY</strong><br/><br/>‘Phenotype’ is the physical manifestation of a gene code or
Genotype. We believe that all design and architectural spaces are
ultimately a physical response to a set of information. The site
conditions and the client brief along with the program and
materiality give us parameters within which we like to evolve a
DNA or set of rules for the project. Our projects span across
product, interiors to architecture and planning. We are able to
use our methodology at various scales. The studio is a boutique
practice which has completed over 75 projects till date. We
continue to evolve and push ourselves in design play. We
approach all projects with a pragmatic, yet playful sensibility and
hope to bring joy and wellness through our work.

18MONTHS</strong><br/>
<b>Anica Kochhar</b>: I knew I wanted to be an architect since I was 11. After a stint at
SPA, I finally had the great honour to study architecture at the Pratt institute the in
the rich and forever moving urban fabric of New York City. After my B.Arch, I
returned to Delhi determined to push the design boundaries in the capital. I worked
with Morphogenesis for a great 2 year stint which gave me lots of confidence in
concept design and gave me a hang of how the architecture and client scene in
India is. In 2008, I joined the Design Research Laboratory at the Architectural
Association in London. This experience gave me great perspective on a global and
culturally diverse platform. At the end of our thesis, our work on genetic
architecture was displayed at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. This is where I imbibed
the logic of bottom up design, not only as a hierarchy but design philosophy
